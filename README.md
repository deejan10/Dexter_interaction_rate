# Dexter Interaction Rate

This script calculates the Dexter Transfer Rate of PL quenching of CsPbCl3 Nano crystal in presence of AgNP. The calculation is based on the donor-acceptor distance and the size of the nanoparticles.

 ## Overview

The Dexter energy transfer rate is a measure of the efficiency with which energy is transferred between a donor and acceptor molecule. This project models this transfer rate as a function of distance between the molecules and the size of the acceptor nanoparticles (AgNPs). The results are visualized using plots generated by `matplotlib`.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The required packages can be installed using `pip`.

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
